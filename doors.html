      <p class="doorsText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tesla model x was built with extremley new and inovative features built into it, one of the most notable being the 4 doors. The model x includes 2 different types of doors including the conventional vehichle doors which are the two front doors, and also a new doors designed by Tesla called the Falcon Wing door which are the two rear doors. Both of these include new technology that was designed and built bty Tesla to help give the doors the functionality that they have. Here is a little bit about each of the types of doors individually and how they work and there purpose.</p>

      <p class="doorsText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Falcon wing doors are positioned in as the 2 rear doors on the car, these doors look to be similar to the gull-wing door type however they function very differently. The doors were designed by Elon Musk and his team at Tesla, they both have two hinges on the door which gives it the flexebility it has. The first hinge is placed at the top mid section of the car and the second is placed above the window. The car is rigged with ultrasonic sensors on the roof and also on the sides to detect how far away the closest object is to the car that the Falcon Wings risk hitting. It reads those sensors and opens the door in an upwards fashion to avoid hitting any obstacles on the sides of the car such as another vehichle, it also uses the roof sensors so it does not lift the doors too high so it doesn's hit the roof in your grarage for example. This allows the rear doors to open in tight parking space where conventional doors would not be able to open it also is good for asthetics as it looks extremly nice and elegant. The car also has sensors on the inside edge of the door to provent the car from closing on fingers or other objects.</p>

      <p class="doorsText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All though the two front doors look like your typicall conventional doors when using them they do not. The door has an feature called the invisible butler, this allows the door to open automatically when it detects the radio pulse generator located in the key fob is coming close. Not only does this feature look good and stylish but it will also help prevent you from hitting nearby cars where as if you were opening it yourself you may accedentily hit the car when opening. This feature also allows you to close the door once you enter and put your foot on the break signafying to the tesla that you are ready to drive, the door will also automaticlly lock and you are ready to drive.</p>
